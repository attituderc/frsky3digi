#  Welcome to the frsky3digi Project!

<img align="left" style="width:35%;height:35%;margin:20px 30px" src="https://github.com/attituderc/frsky3digi/blob/master/board.png"> The 3 Digi flight controller is very configurable and the Frsky family of RX and TX are very capable. Our idea is to get them together much like the Vcontrol and Vbar. We want to control the set up and configuration of the 3 Digi via the Frsky radio. Utilizing the 2 way communication on the frsky receivers. We are currently starting up this project. No code is ready as of yet, hopefully soon. We are working with the developers at 3digi, mostly they are supporting the project with great information.
Currently all the development is being done on my flying hardware. This slows the development down a bit, as sometime I like to fly.

The files that are here are the start of the project. They are not ready and just the loose framework. 

The .bmp files get moved to the IMAGES/ directory

This is a fully open sourced project.

**The project has a lot of needs at this point.**

Programmers
* Frsky Lua scripts
* Frsky serial
* Serial

We need hardware for testing.
* 3Digi (new or used)
* FrSky receivers 

We need people willing to test on their hardware
* Horus X12S
* Horus X10S
* Taranis Plus (X9D+)
* Taranis Q X7
* Different Receivers 

Project donations are accepted. The more hardware we have and the more support, the faster we can have the code written and tested. If you donate hardware, I will make sure it gets back to you after development has completed (if requested).
This is a not for profit development project.
If you would like to help in anyway Please email me at brad@attituderc.com.
